# Artificial-intelligence
This repository explores AI and Computer Vision using Python. It covers foundational image processing—such as scanning, resizing, and blurring—alongside more advanced techniques like adaptive thresholding. Using Matplotlib and CV libraries, the projects demonstrate how to visualize data and process live video for real-time applications.

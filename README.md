# Artificial-intelligence
This repository documents my exploration into the intersection of Digital Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence. Each project demonstrates a fundamental building block in how machines perceive, interpret, and manipulate visual environments.It covers foundational image processing—such as scanning, resizing, and blurring—alongside more advanced techniques like adaptive thresholding, using Matplotlib and CV libraries.
